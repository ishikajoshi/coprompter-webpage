        <h2>CoPrompter🚀 for Prompt Engineering</h2>
        <p>
          Ensuring large language models' (LLMs) responses
          <strong>align</strong> with prompt instructions is crucial for
          application development. Based on our formative study with industry
          professionals, the alignment requires
          <em>heavy human involvement and tedious trial-and-error</em>
          especially when there are many instructions in the prompt. To address
          these challenges, we introduce
          <span style="color: #6f60ed"><strong>CoPrompter</strong></span
          >, a framework that identifies <strong>misalignment</strong> based on
          assessing multiple LLM responses with criteria. It proposes a method
          to generate <em>evaluation criteria questions</em> derived directly
          from prompt requirements and an interface to turn these questions into
          a user-editable checklist. ✨ Our user study with industry prompt
          engineers shows that
          <span style="color: #6f60ed"><strong>CoPrompter</strong></span>
          improves the ability to identify and refine instruction alignment with
          prompt requirements over traditional methods, helps them understand
          where and how frequently models fail to follow user's prompt
          requirements, and aids in clarifying their own requirements, giving
          them greater control over the response evaluation process. 🔍 We also
          present the design lessons to underscore our system's potential to
          streamline the prompt engineering process. 🚀

        <!-- <p> -->
        <p>
          The <strong>CoPrompter system workflow</strong> begins with (1) the
          <strong>Evaluation Criteria Generation Module</strong>, where user
          prompt requirements (guidelines) are broken down into atomic
          instructions. These instructions are then formulated as
          <strong>criteria questions (CQs)</strong> with ground truth labels and
          metadata tags (e.g., <strong>main task</strong>,
          <strong>subtask</strong>, or <strong>format-related</strong>). ✨
        </p>

        <p>
          Users can adjust these criteria in (2) the
          <strong>Update Criteria Module</strong> by <strong>editing</strong>,
          <strong>deleting</strong>, or <strong>adding new CQs</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, in (3) the <strong>Prompt Response Generation Module</strong>,
          users input their prompt, select an <strong>LLM</strong>, and generate
          responses. 📝 The responses are evaluated against the defined
          criteria, with results displayed in (4) the
          <strong>Alignment Report Card Module</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This report shows aligned and misaligned requirements, allowing users
          to explore misalignments in detail. 📊 Based on the feedback, users
          can <strong>refine</strong> their prompt or criteria, iterating as
          needed to improve alignment. 🔄
